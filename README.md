## What is Terraform ?
- Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that lets you build, change, and version infrastructure safely and efficiently.

- It lets you define both cloud and on-premises resources in human-readable configuration files that you can version, reuse, and share.

## The Problem with Manual Configuration.
Manually configuring your cloud infrastructure allows you to easily start using new service offerings to quickly prototype architectures however it comes with many downsides:

1. It’s easy to mis-configure a service through human error.

2. It’s hard to manage the expected state of configuration for compliance.

3. Its hard to transfer configuration to other team members.
